                <h3>Dead Space</h3>
                <p><i>A repair team responds to the distress call of the USG Ishimura after it uncovers an alien artifact.
                </i></p>
                <p>One of the greatest horror games. The setting, enemy design, and sound design are top notch, with unique limb-cutting mechanics and an
                    array of repurposed mining tools at you disposal. 
                </p>

                <h3>Terraria</h3>
                <p><i>Adventure forth, acquire gear, and slay bosses in the world of Terraria.</i></p>
                <p>A solid RPG with different classes, building, and boss-slaying. There's a whole slew of mechanics that have been added over the years, meaning there'
                    always something to do.
                </p>

                <h3>Minecraft</h3>
                <p><i>A sandbox adventure where the sky's the limit.</i></p>
                <p>A classic game that I've been playing on and off for a long time. The simple focus of mining and crafting has always brought me back. My friends
                    and I usually start a server once a year.
